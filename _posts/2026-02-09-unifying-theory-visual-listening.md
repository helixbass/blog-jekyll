As I'm learning Adobe Illustrator I am confident asserting a theory of
the underlying "skill set being exercised" in both visual "art" and
being good at playing music

I've understood for years (via jazz training) that really what you're
good at when you're actually good at music is _your ear_ aka _listening_.
Playing an instrument is secondary/flows from that. And voila I in fact
can play multiple instruments in a cool way because my ear is strong

So really the music you make/the playing you do is an expression of what
your ear is capable of/thinks is cool. And you're constantly improvising
against that ear. Again this is taught/well-understood in jazz training

Ok so I'll assert that it's the same with visual arts. But with your eye
instead of your ear. So presumably then (symmetrically) it's not really
about the mechanics of drawing/etc, it's about having a visually stylish
eye. I've noticed/believed for years that people who are visually artistic
tend to have good eyesight and perhaps correspondingly cool-looking eyes

Ya no sh** they probably live in a world of visual gag. And so then
"the ideas in their head" (aka their "eye") are cooler than yours visually.
And more "precise"/"high-fidelity"

So ya they probably don't sit there violently tearing the paper attempting
to somehow all of a sudden be good at drawing when they make art. They
probably see what they're going for clearly in their head/"eye" and then
get good-enough at expressing what they visually "see"/"judge" in whatever
visual-art medium

Also if you don't know visually artistic people tend to be good at _all_
visual-art media
