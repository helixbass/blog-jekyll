"Holding the breath" is always a terrible idea

But if you analyze the mechanics of how people try and
navigate situations you often see it implicitly being done/"advertised"

Do ya really think it's going to take you to a _better_ place to hold your breath?

Look at it from the angle of "flow"

Specifically holding the breath is a weird/nonsensical attempt to try and get things
to stop flowing

Why would someone want things to stop flowing?

Because they're [tripping about thinking that things are physically spatial that aren't](/physically-spatial-mistake)
