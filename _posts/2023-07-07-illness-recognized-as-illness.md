This is another "building block" idea.
The idea logically is that all it effectively takes for
illness to [resolve](/healing-as-liquefying) is just for
it to be recognized as illness

Honestly if your reaction is "no there are diseases that
can't be cured" etc I'm not interested. (a) I don't know that
from my own experience (b) that's not really understanding [the
nature of analysis](/the-nature-of-analysis)
