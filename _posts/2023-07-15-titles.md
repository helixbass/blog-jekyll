[This is slightly riffing off of the work of [Miles Mathis](http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html),
who has clearly demonstrated what eg "Earls" really are]

It has to be the dweebiest toolbags of all time who came up with the idea of
giving themselves "titles" like "Earl" etc

Think about it from a "stance" perspective

Game over
