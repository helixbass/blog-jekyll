The [wannabe-oppressors](/who-are-the-wannabe-oppressors) love trying
to use language to manipulate people (and remember it's all just [trying to leverage illness](/trying-to-leverage-illness-is-not-cute))

One of the "techniques" they love to reach for is to try and come up with
a new "ism" to try and "stun people out" with

The whole concept of an "ism" is real f\*\*\*ing [retarded](/retard-is-positive)
when you actually juxtapose it with how reality actually works/feels

No-one actually engages with things like that

No-one cares like that

People don't do things for the reasons they're acting like people do

Examples if I need to spell it out:

Terrorism

Communism/socialism

Catholicism

You need to get to where you picture dorky J\*\*s who don't recognize
your actual existence as a human being coming up with this sh\*\*
