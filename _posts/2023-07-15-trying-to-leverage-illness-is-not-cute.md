It only takes a basic grasp of how energy works 
(plus the premise that [we're all ill](/were-all-ill))
to see that most of what you run into of people trying to
"act like they are in some good position relative to you"/"act
like they know" must logically be them trying to "leverage (their own) illness"

(because they have no actual energy, so what are the mechanics of
them trying to act like they do? They must be "tapping into the only thing they
are aware that they have access to" which is their own (parasitic) illness)

Which is f\*\*\*ing immeasurably disgusting

Why would you do that?

Don't you want to look cute?
