title: "Classic idiotic tactic of the wannabe-oppressors: acting as though they are intermediaries between you and good things"

A pattern that starts to become pretty obvious if you
analyze the energy of what you experience and reconcile that
with some awareness of [who the wannabe-oppressors are](/who-are-the-wannabe-oppressors)
is that they (and others suffering from similar illness) love to
try and ["position themselves"](/physically-spatial-mistake) such
that you actually buy into the idea that in order to experience
good/enjoyable things you need to "get access to those things"
through them

ie that they are "intermediaries" who have some sort of "privileged"
access to the types of things that you would want and they will
either at their arbitrary discretion or supposedly according to some
"framework"/set of rules grant you access to those things

Quick shredding of that idea:

The nature of reality is obviously such that we have direct access
to energy (including eg the energy of things that we've experienced)
at all times

So they're going to have to come up with some really twisted-up sh\*\* to
convince us to lose sight of/connection to that and get us to buy into the
idea that no we don't just "have access" to good things, we need it to be
granted to us

Ok so let's think big. We're going to need to convince people that life "by
definition" is or is not certain things. We need frameworks and we need to
leverage whatever ways of "selling" that we can to get people to stay in a
state of believing that

Ok we love reaching for language because we're mega-dweebs

So let's come up with glorious little ["language-castles"](/physically-spatial-mistake)
that people will get stuck in/overwhelmed by and they'll just [pull up short](/pulling-up-short)
and say "ok I guess I'll go along with that" (ie "I guess that is what life is, or at least
I guess I'll sort of "say" that I believe that that's what life is")

Think [religion](/the-church)

And generalize that and think ["-isms"](/isms) in general

Think [money](/why-money-actually-exists)

Think of the idea that only people with "certifications"/["titles"](/titles) have "actual knowledge"/understanding
and that you're just a little nobody who's at their mercy

For example doctors "owning" the realm of "healing"

Um quick disproof there: if my finger gets cut it "magically" heals on its own
without going to a doctor or doing anything else except time passing

Really where this goes is an analysis of the [parasitic](/parasitic-illness) nature of
the illness that [everyone is experiencing](/were-all-ill)

Since those are the actual mechanics

And it is clearly an instance of [trying to leverage illness](/trying-to-leverage-illness-is-not-cute)
