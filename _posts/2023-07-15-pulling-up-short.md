An import pattern/"moment" to recognize as far as
the mechanics of ending up in a state of illness
(specifically [sagginess](/sagginess)) where you
can be taken advantage of by parasites is:

> That moment when you go "ok I guess I'll go along with that"

That is called "pulling up short"

It is not nearly as innocuous as it may seem

Very related to why I think [compromise](/compromise) is such a
terrible concept

Because it has baked into it this idea of "ok even though this isn't what
I'm actually wanting right now/doesn't "feel right" to me, I'm going to not
only go ahead and do it, I'm going to [tell myself](/the-mechanics-of-storytelling)
that it's the "correct"/"superior"/"right" thing to do"

Terrible choice

"If it doesn't feel right in your gut don't do it. Ever. There are horrible
energetic consequences for doing otherwise"

"But \_\_\_\_\_ (some thing that I'm convinced I "need" to do even though I don't want to)"

Yeah f\*\*\* that

First of all analyze it for yourself

Otherwise you are wasting energy randomly

And you cannot expect good things to happen by spending energy randomly/"thoughtlessly"

What you will find is that no it is not the nature of life/reality that you
"have to do things"

An easy disproof is that that is obviously an instance of
[acting like things are only ok if a certain thing happens at a certain time](/tearing-down-things-being-ok-fallacy)

Now analyze the "tone" of what you should be noticing are the "voices" that
are trying to make you think that you have to do whatever thing

You need to get to where they sound like the f\*\*\*ing toolbags that they are

Doesn't matter if it's a family member etc etc

There are no "exceptions" to analysis

It should be obvious that it would not be in your interest to make such exceptions

And if you don't think you should be acting in your own interest then you are
super severely bought into some bullsh\*\*
