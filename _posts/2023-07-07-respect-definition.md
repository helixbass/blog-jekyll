In my opinion "respect" = "treating things as though they're real"

Life tends to punish you for not "showing respect" in that sense

It does not reward random self-indulgent sh**

Why do people do random self-indulgent sh**?

Clearly it's some form of illness

Here the idea/mechanism that comes to mind is that [storytelling](/the-mechanics-of-storytelling)
is often the culprit
