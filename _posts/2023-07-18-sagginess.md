This is very related to [the mistake of thinking
that things are physically spatial that aren't](/physically-spatial-mistake)

First, "non-sagginess":

When someone is actually connected to reality, they get a lot
of energy from doing so. It's characteristic of reality that
your interactions with it are very "rich" and enjoyable

Whereas if a person _thinks they're interacting with reality but in fact
are putting their energy into trying to interact with something that isn't
actually there_, they get no energy from doing so

(because... it's not actually there. How you can expect something that's not
there to eg "give you energy"?)

So "sagginess" describes that "outside perspective" of seeing someone think
that they're interacting with something but in fact it's not there, and
the physical space that they think they're in is a stagnant pocket of
unprocessed sh\*\*. Because that absence of them getting anything from
this supposed interaction just looks like them completely "sagging out"
