The existence of money is explained very neatly by what
appears to be the [underlying agenda](/wannabe-oppressors-underlying-agenda)
of the [wannabe-oppressors](/who-are-the-wannabe-oppressors)

How?

Let's think about the mechanics of executing such an agenda

While apparently there have been times/places where people have been
"explicitly enslaved", in general people are not huge fans of the idea
that they are someone else's property. So the wannabe-oppressors figured out
that they were better off trying to achieve that agenda secretly, ie to
(apparently in their f\*\*\*ed-up way of thinking) have people be their property
without those people recognizing that they are their property

Also given that the "scope" of the agenda is clearly defined as "all people
everywhere", and that there's not actually a lot of the wannabe-oppressors,
they were going to have to find ways to achieve this enslavement _without
actually being physically present_

Ok so if you were designing something to enslave people without them knowing
that they were enslaved and where you didn't have to be physically present
as part of executing the enslaving what might that thing look like?

Well ok apparently as part-and-parcel of this agenda we think that we
[own everything](/ownership-is-not-cute) (so f\*\*\*ing gnarly when analyzed
as illness)

And therefore we are [in charge of whether people get to experience good things
or not](/wannabe-oppressors-intermediaries). No indication of suffering from the
[thinking you're in a narrow space fallacy](thinking-that-youre-in-a-narrower-space-than-you-actually-are/).
No we are obviously in total control of this space that we're in. No doubt about it
that is our premise/starting point

Ok great so we just sort of have to act that out. As long as we maintain the premise
that we are the intermediaries between people and getting to experience good things/what they
want, then we can control their behavior (which I guess is what "having them be their property"
is supposedly consisting of? Getting people to do certain things at certain times that you decided
you wanted them to do?)

Because inevitably they're going to be motivated to actually get to experience those things
that they want to experience. So we just have to sell the sh\*\* out of the idea that the only
way for them to achieve that is through us. Because it's true right we control everything?

[Super tall order! Given that it's screamingly obvious that what life/reality actually are is
something where you can do whatever the f\*\*\* you want all the time]

Ok so we just need to create a system that has baked into it this idea of "need". Everyone
"needs" this thing in order to experience the things they want to experience

Oh no ok [I guess I'll go along with that](/pulling-up-short), I'm not quite confident enough
to tell them to go f\*\*\* themselves

Oh and by "everyone" we mean "all the enslaved people", obviously we would design it in a way
where we never had any of the "need" (because we own/control everything remember?)

Ok cool so let's make it a thing that somehow doesn't draw too much attention to itself "as a
designed system" (and specifically as a system designed for these reasons). We'll just sell a
bunch of [retarded](/retard-is-positive) perspectives on what it is/why it's there/why the "need"
is real/unquestionable

Oh here's a good one black people (say black men specifically) seem to be not the most bought
in to the idea that they actually want to participate in this stuff, let's leverage the fact
that we [control the media](/why-media-actually-exists) and get the next generation of "cool
black musician men" (aka rappers) to really drill home the idea that this "stack of paper"
actually is cool/desirable/what you should be spending your energy trying to achieve. Brilliant!
We're such clever little b\*\*\*\*es!

Specifically in terms of the mechanics, money is clearly designed in a way where the wannabe-oppressors
have many many many more orders of magnitude of money than everyone else. That way if you can
typically "convince" someone to do something by dangling an amount of money in front of them that to
them seems "life-changing" etc but to you makes zero difference at all, you just do that whenever
"the need arises". Disgusting. So completely idiotic/numb
