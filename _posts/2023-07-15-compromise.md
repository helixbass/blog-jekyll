I always disliked when my mother specifically would
reach for a concept of "compromise" in trying to eg
mediate things between my sister and I

Looking back that's some sloppy sh\*\*

Super easy to analyze as "pretending to resolve something
but in fact leaving things feeling worse"

Aka [illness not being recognized as illness](/illness-recognized-as-illness)

And then trying to sell that as some "superior moralistic"
behavior

"Because obviously logically we have to compromise in order for everyone to
get what they want, that's how life works"

Um no to me as a possessor of male energy it feels far cleaner/simpler/more logical
to just destroy the other thing and then it's not there anymore

Problem solved!
