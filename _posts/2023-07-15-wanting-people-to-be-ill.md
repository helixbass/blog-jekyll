Given the [insane agenda](/wannabe-oppressors-underlying-agenda) of
the [wannabe-oppressors](/who-are-the-wannabe-oppressors), it actually
is logical that they want people to be in a state of illness/immaturity

Why? Because people who have much connection to reality at all (ie are
a little bit healthy) are not going to buy into the loads of ridiculous
frameworks that are required to start to participate in their bullsh\*\*

Aka "people who are even a little bit healthy are hard to enslave"
