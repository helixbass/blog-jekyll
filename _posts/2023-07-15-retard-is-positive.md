Because it points at a concept of healthiness, as well as
at the concept that a currently "retarded" person could
heal

The [wannabe-oppressors](/who-are-the-wannabe-oppressors) are
motivated because of their insane [underlying agenda](/wannabe-oppressors-underlying-agenda)
to [have us all be in an ongoing state of illness](/wanting-people-to-be-ill)

And for illness not to resolve, it has to [not be recognized as illness](/illness-recognized-as-illness)

Therefore they need for us not to recognize that we are in a state of illness

But a word/concept like "retard" actually does have "energy behind it" of
recognizing illness as illness

Thus wanting to label that word as bad

And correspondingly wanting to try and explicitly "normalize" illness

Oh and what a shock they're being their usual toolbag-language-y-dweeby selves
and reaching for language as a way to try and accomplish that

So clever that they can come up with phrases like "neurotypical"!

What a "heady" way of looking at things

Seriously how ridiculously out of touch with the "rhythm" of reality (aka ill)
do you have to be to buy into sh\*\* like that

Male energy gonna straighten you out real quick kid. Like real quick
