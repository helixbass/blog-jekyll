Analysis as an "angle"/"activity":

Light-hearted. But that's not a 
[negative definition](/negative-definition) (ie "light-heartedness"
doesn't mean the absence of certain tones/"heaviness", think of it more like
a song with a light-hearted tone)

The thing that that's calling out is that people can start "weighing down" the
activity (with what might be called "self-seriousness") anytime you'd be thinking/talking
about something "serious"

No let's not do that it's not cute

And it's not the point
